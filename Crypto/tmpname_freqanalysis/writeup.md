The flag is hidden in this drawing.
If you are familiar with frequent analysis you will
see that some of the figures are more frequent than others. 
You can therefore deduce the flag with the ETAOIN principle.
Where some letters are more frequent than other letters.
But watch out, this may not apply everywhere ;)

PS. Remember the structure of the flags "{}"
