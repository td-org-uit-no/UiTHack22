"Han Solo needs a password manager" 

Han Solo and Chewbacka is flying the Milenium Falcon trough space. 
Out of nowhere the Falcon stops!!!! 
-"WHAT IS HAPPENING" yells Han 
-"Rrrrrrr-ghghghghgh" answers Chewbacca.
-"Yeah, you are right! It is probably that" says Han.
-"Rrrr-ghghg-rrrr" Chewbacca snares!
-"I will fix it fast, don't worry!"
The computer on the falcon does a self test and the result is that 
the computer needs to reset.
-"SHIT! I dont remember the password!"
-"ghghgh-rrrr!"
-"Thats right I have a note for that" 
Han Solo pulls up the note and looks shocked. He does not remember 
anything about the password and he needs your help!
