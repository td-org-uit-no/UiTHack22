By using the inspect on the website one can find the endpoint to an login page commented in the header. The passord for the page is found within the map's svg. If one compare the world map with another world map, can one see there is an additional island in the atlantic ocean. By inspecting the island, finding it in the svg will give the name of Elandia.
