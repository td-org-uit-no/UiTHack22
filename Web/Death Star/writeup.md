># Death Star

>The alliance has gained access to the empire's internal website about their newest weapon, the death star. The information is alarming, but the text seems a bit odd. Can you find out what is missing?

---------------- write up -----------------------

The text is clearly missing some letter which are made invisible by setting opacity to 0 in the css. The flag can be retrived by hovering over each missing spot in the text or by changing the opacity of all span elements to 1. One can also just guess most of the letters missing.
