> Web - 50pts

Leia, Princess of Alderaan, political and military leader who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, needs your help. 
She has forgotten her username and her password, again..., to log into the Alliance database where the schematics of the Death Star must be uploaded! She knows that her crew in the Alliance remember her forgetfulness, and have made it very simple for her to find her credentials.

Can you take a look, and help restore balance to the universe?
