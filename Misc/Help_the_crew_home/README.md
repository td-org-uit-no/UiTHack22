# Help the crew home!
> Misc - 200 pts

The Xwing had to reboot the system causing coordinates and route-data home to get 
partly wiped.

Luckily C-3PO always gathers graphical waypoints at all times, which can help the crew regenerate the route!
We need to analyze where to *Spatial frequency response* is initialized at a certain spots. 

C-3OP has calculated the needed spatial frequency numbers to extract the data, but is unable to do it himself due to poor hardware.
Hack into C-3OP snapshot-history and analyze his history to gather the last information.
