Han Solo and Chewbacka is flying the Milenium Falcon through space.  
Out of nowhere the Falcon stops!!!! 
-"WHAT IS HAPPENING" yells Han  
-"Rrrrrrr-ghghghghgh" answers Chewbacca.  
-"Yeah, you are right! It is probably that" says Han.  
-"Rrrr-ghghg-rrrr" Chewbacca snares!  
-"I will fix it fast, don't worry!"  
The computer on the falcon does a self test and the result is that   
the computer needs to reset.  
-"SHIT! I dont remember the password!"  
-"ghghgh-rrrr!"  
-"Thats right I have a note for that"  
Han Solo pulls up the note and looks shocked. He does not remember  
anything about the password and he needs your help!
