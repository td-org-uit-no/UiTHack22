A brave team of engineers from the Distributed Interstellar Patient System (DIPS) have recovered a secret file which could point to a vulnerability in the Empire's defenses.

Sadly, the engineers are missing a key piece of equipment to find this vulnerability - can you help?

Hint 1: Replicators neither exist in Star Wars nor in real life... but do you have something close to one? What's a "facet normal" anyway?

Hint 2: You might need to make a trench run of your own - your ship will need to be a real *slicer* or a *blender*...

Hint 3: If it's tricky to spot the vulnerability, look for the "wireframe" or "X-ray" switch...
