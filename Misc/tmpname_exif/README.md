# Help the crew home!

The Xwing had to reboot the system causing coordinates and route-data home to get 
partly wiped.

Luckily C-3PO always gathers graphical waypoints at all times, which can help the crew regenerate the route!
We need to analyze where to efix *Spatial frequency response* is initialized at a certain value. 

C-3OP has calculated the needed spatial frequency number to extract the data, but is unable to do it himself due to poor hardware.
Hack into C-3OP snapshot-history and get the last needed values to complete the flag. 




Spatial freq. respons| Lost data| Route/flag
