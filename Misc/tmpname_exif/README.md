# Help the crew home!

The Xwing had to reboot the system causing coordinates and route-data home to get 
partly wiped.
Space is weird and complicated therefore directions can be represented as a flag. Don't ask questions, it's too hard for you to understand, flags works!
Luckily C-3PO always gathers graphical waypoints at all times, which can help the crew regenerate the route!
We need the second-indiced-FlashEnergy-value where to efix Spatial frequency response is at complete balance.


C-3OP has calculated the needed spatial frequency number to extract the data, but is unable to do it himself due to poor hardware.
Hack into C-3OP snapshot-history and get the last eight digits to complete the flag.
