Well this is kind of awkward. If you are decoding this bit by(te) bit for hand i if feel sorry for you, but it is certainly possible to get through this! The true brute-force-warrior within you will probably be broken allready this far, but i encourage you to keep going! Sooner or later i will leak a solution that will make this much easier for all of us, getting those tasty brute-forced points to win this competition. Well, that was the intro, so here comes some gibberish shit to fill the text with. I'll put the flag in somewhere 3/4 of the text. Good luck! 

1.Why was the new band '1023 MB' extremely sad? Because since their formation, they haven't had a gig yet! 
2. How did the good teacher know how to teach computer programming to the inpatient boy? He taught the kid about computers bit by bit!
3.While visiting a zoo, which animal does a computer like watching the most? It definitely has to be a RAM!
4.Why is the number 237 magical?Because it is Hex ED

If you have decoded all bits this far, not screwed up any single one of them and you can read this in actual English, Kudos for you! I feel this effort actually deserves some sympathy-points, so here you go UitHack22{BruteForceWarriors<3}! Note this is not the primary flag, and the actual flag is still in here somewhere ;) Well, let's go gibberish again..later aligator.
TIPS: Obtain a deep learning model detecting 0's and 1's from the binary images or some other automated tech. This will behead the inner brute-force-warrior, but we are lazy and there are other tasks awaiting! well here comes some more gibberish jokes.

Alright i think we've had enough of this shit.
THIS IS THE FLAG:UitHack22{IReallyDoHopeYouDidNotbruteForceThis}
This next text is just to fill in the last part of the text and make sure the flag is not placed at the end of this absurd task. I really hope there was some fun to this task, and it was no somewhat doable.
I'll see you in the next task, cya!;)
