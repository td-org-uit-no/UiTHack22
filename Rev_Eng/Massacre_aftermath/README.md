> Rev-Eng - 400 pts

After the violent boarding of the CR90 corvette Tantive IV by Lord Vader, the commanders have instructed you to break into the rebel computer systems and access the flight logs.  
Lord Vader is personally overseeing this process so you quickly find your way to a terminal by the docking bay.  
In this terminal you are met with a login prompt, and not wanting to be cut in half you do your best to break past their encryption schemes.

Hint: Have you tried cutting it open?
Hint: This seems very proprietary, must be flawed somehow...
