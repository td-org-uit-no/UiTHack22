# Ephemeral

You are on a nighttime mission to infiltrate the secret Empire facility known as Re-Al-Phagby G, and rescue the brave programmers imprisoned within.

However, a numeric keypad lock blocks your way! While nobody is around, the Empire has introduced countermeasures to stop people from simply trying every password.

Can you still break in?

Hint 1. We know we only have to try numbers for the password. Try different numbers - do you notice any differences?

Hint 2. Look closer at the supposed countermeasure to stop bruteforcing - when does it actually trigger?
