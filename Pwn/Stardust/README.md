> Pwn - 100 pts

Rebel forces have infiltrated the imperial base on on Sarif and are looking for the deathstar plans.  
They are unfortunately hidden somewhere in the system and you only have access to this stardust program.  
Can you find the plans hidden somewhere in the program?

Hint: Are there any ways you can manipulate the program?

Hint 2: Can you break it somehow?
